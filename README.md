Hypercomplex Numbers from Cayleyâ€“Dickson Construction

This C++ library explores complex numbers plus its extentions from
Cayley-Dickson construction, such as quaternions and octonions.  The
implementation centers around several class templates and many operator
and other function templates.  C++11 features will be used, so your
compiler and standard library need to be set to run in C++11 mode.

The format of the library is like a prototype Boost library submission.
As such, the code is under the Boost license.
